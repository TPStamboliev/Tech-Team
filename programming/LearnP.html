      <h1>What is C++?</h1>
      <p>C++ is a high-performance, compiled, and general-purpose programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.</p>
      <h1>Variables and Data Types</h1>
      <p>In C++, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. C++ has several built-in data types, including int, float, char, and bool.</p>
      <h1>Operators and Control Structures</h1>
      <p>C++ has various operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operations. It also has control structures such as if-else statements, switch statements, and loops (for, while, do-while).</p>
      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <p>In C++, a function is a block of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program. Functions can take arguments and return values.</p>
      <h1>Arrays and Vectors</h1>
      <p>In C++, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. A vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.</p>
      <h1>Array Declaration:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>To declare an array, specify the data type, the array name, and the number of elements it should store.</li>
        <li>Syntax: dataType arrayName[arraySize];</li>
        <li>Example: int x[6]; declares an integer array named x with a size of 6.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Accessing Array Elements:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Each element in an array is associated with an index (starting from 0).</li>
        <li>Access elements using the syntax: array[index].</li>
        <li>For example, x[0] is the first element, and x[5] is the last element.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Operator "While"</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>"While" repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.</li>
        <li>It evaluates the condition before entering the loop body.</li>
        <li>If the condition is false initially, the loop won’t execute at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Operator "Do"</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>"Do"executes its body at least once, regardless of the condition.</li>
        <li>It evaluates the condition after executing the loop body.s</li>
      </ul>
