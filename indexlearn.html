    <h2>What is C++?</h2>
    <p>C++ is a high-performance, compiled, and general-purpose programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.</p>
    <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <p>In C++, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. C++ has several built-in data types, including int, float, char, and bool.</p>
    <h2>Operators and Control Structures</h2>
    <p>C++ has various operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operations. It also has control structures such as if-else statements, switch statements, and loops (for, while, do-while).</p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>In C++, a function is a block of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program. Functions can take arguments and return values.</p>
    <h2>Arrays and Vectors</h2>
    <p>In C++, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. A vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.</p>
